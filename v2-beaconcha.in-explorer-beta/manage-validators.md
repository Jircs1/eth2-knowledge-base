# ⚒️ Manage Validators

This is the place where you can add and delete validators and assign them to groups. (Groups can be created in the Group Manage modal on the dashboard)

The dropdown in the left top corner has two usecases:

1.  Filter for a specific group

    * To view validators from a specific group, select the group from the top left dropdown.
    * Adding a validator while a group filter is active assigns the validator to that group.
    * Adding a validator under 'All groups' sets the default group for the newly added validator.

    \
    <mark style="color:red;">\[xxx]</mark>\

2.  Quick add to a group

    * Adding a validator while a group filter is active assigns the validator to that group.
    * Adding a validator under 'All groups' sets the default group for the newly added validator.

    \
    <mark style="color:red;">\[xxx]</mark>\
