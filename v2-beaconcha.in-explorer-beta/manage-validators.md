# ⚒️ Manage Validators

This is the place where you can add and delete validators and assign them to groups. (Groups can be created in the Group Manage modal on the dashboard)



***

The dropdown in the left top corner has two use cases:

#### Filter for a specific group

* To view validators from a specific group, select the group from the top left dropdown.
* Adding a validator while a group filter is active assigns the validator to that group.
* Adding a validator under 'All groups' sets the default group for the newly added validator.

#### Quick add to a group

* Adding a validator while a group filter is active assigns the validator to that group.
* Adding a validator under 'All groups' sets the default group for the newly added validator.
